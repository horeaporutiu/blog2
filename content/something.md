I enjoy writing code and being outside. I'm currently working as a Developer Advocate
for IBM, promoting IBM's Platform-As-A-Service Bluemix. I graduated from UC San Diego in
March 2017 with a double major in Computer & Management Science. I played tennis for the UC San Diego Men's Tennis Team and competed in over 140 matches.<img src="../../img/tennis.jpg" class="thumbnail pull-right" style="width:25%; min-width: 150px">
When I was not on the court, I was in the classroom or at office hours trying to excel in my classes.

I currently coach tennis in my free time, through a website called thumbtack.

<h2 id="start">How I got Started</h2>
 I have a bit under 3 years of coding experience, with my first completed coding class coming in June of 2014 at UC San Diego. Ever since then, I have been determined to hone my skills and improve every day. Just under a year after I started coding, I got my first internship at
<a href="https://www.achieveinternet.com/">Achieve Internet</a> and gained industry web-development experience. Using Drupal and a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, I developed sites and worked closely with the full-time engineers. After that, I started developing my own iOS apps using Swift, and playing around with web-development on my own.
