So first and foremost I want to make a shoutout to Jacob W. Green, who wrote this
<a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-augmented-reality-with-unity">great post</a>
about getting started with Augmented Reality. It's extremely easy to follow, and very informative.
His post uses augmented reality to overlay an image of an author over the cover of the corresponding book. Now this may or may not sound appealing to you, but I am extremely excited
to be going to <a href="http://www.augmentedworldexpo.com/">AWE (Augmented World Expo)</a>
next week, and what better way to get familiar with AR than by building a project. But first...what <i>is</i> Augmented Reality?

<hr>

<h4 id="setup">What is Augmented Reality</h4>
<br>
Augmented Reality(AR) is the process of overlaying media (text, video, images, sound) onto physical objects or locations through a camera lens of a smartphone, tablet or head-mounted display. You may be wondering, what exactly is a head-mounted display? Well, to put it simply, it's a smart helmet. Some of the more prevalent ones on the market right now are the Microsoft HoloLens and the <a href="https://daqri.com/products/smart-helmet/">(DAQRI - Smart Helmet)</a>.

<h4 id="setup">Why is Augmented Reality Important</h4>

<br>
Augmented Reality has been around for the better part of the last decade, and was brought into the spotlight last year by the launch of Pokemon Go. Now you may think that Augmented Reality is only useful for gaming, but I completely disagree. After taking a Human Computer Interaction for Healthcare Class, I have found how useful AR can be in training medical professionals. Currently, CAE Healthcare has become a pioneer in the medical industry for developing Augmented Reality ultrasound simulators which allow students to interact with the holograms. By using the <a href="https://daqri.com/products/smart-helmet/">Microsoft HoloLens</a>, students are able to see a hologram that represents human anatomy and learn in a more visual and interactive setting. As Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality become more prevalent, we will see many more use cases and implementations of AR and VR in clinical training for the medical industry.

<h4 id="setup">My first Augmented Reality App</h4>

So I made this iOS app just to learn a bit more about Unity, Vuforia and other technologies that help make Augmented Reality apps. So my app is essentially a Snapchat filter. Almost. Unfortunately, it can't recognize anyones face. I trained the computer to only recognize my badge. So when it sees my badge, it overlays an batman mask over my face ;) If you want help making something like this, just follow <a href="http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-augmented-reality-with-unity">Jacob Green's blog</a>.
